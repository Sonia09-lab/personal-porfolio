    <h2>Catering Reservation and Ordering System</h2>
    <p>Catering is a website that allows counter developers to promote and sell their
catering. Rural towns would be able to sell their commodities to the rest of the
globe as a result of this.
The goal of this project is to establish a portal that will allow users to buy catering
from the admin and change product information securely using a mobile device.
Catering is given priority in order to allow them to develop their skills and promote
our traditional Indian culture.</p>

    <h2>Student- Teacher Booking Appointment</h2>
    <p>Booking appointment systems, either online or through traditional queueing
systems, are now popular. Several businesses, such as scheduling an appointment,
employ various Web-based appointment systems for their patients, which improve
the efficiency of the appointment process, reducing patient wait times and
increasing the total number of patients treated. This research proposes a webbased
appointment booking system that allows students and lecturers to be aware
of their appointment time regardless of where they are by using the web or mobile
devices. By connecting to the Internet, students and instructors can easily access
the system. It also permits students to send any message, including the
appointment's purpose and timing.</p>
